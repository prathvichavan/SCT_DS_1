# **Visualization of Data Distribution**

## **Description**  
This project focuses on visualizing the distribution of a categorical or continuous variable, such as ages or genders, in a population. The analysis includes creating a bar chart or histogram to provide insights into the data's distribution.

Key Highlights:  
- Data preprocessing to handle categorical or continuous variables.  
- Implementation of visualization techniques using Python libraries.  
- Clear and concise representation of data through bar charts or histograms.

## **Usage**
The notebook processes the dataset to visualize the distribution of a selected variable. Examples include:

*Bar Chart for Categorical Variables*
The script creates a bar chart to showcase the frequency distribution of categories.

*Histogram for Continuous Variables*
For continuous variables like ages, a histogram illustrates the data's spread and concentration.

## **Results**
The output visualizations provide meaningful insights into the dataset:

Bar Chart: Clearly depicts the distribution of categorical variables like gender.
Histogram: Displays the frequency distribution of continuous variables such as age.
These visualizations help identify patterns and trends within the data.
